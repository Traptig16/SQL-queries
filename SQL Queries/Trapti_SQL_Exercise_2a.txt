All Queries to be executed in Shakila database
1. Get list of tables 
select * from pg_catalog.pg_tables;
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';

2. GET LIST OF COLUMNS AND DATA TYPES
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'your_table_name'
AND table_schema = 'public';


3. Get list of Schema, tables, columns.
SELECT table_schema, table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('information_schema', 'pg_catalog')
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;

4. Get list of constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Check Constraints).
SELECT conname AS constraint_name, conrelid::regclass AS table_name, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) AS constraint_definition
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid::regclass::text NOT LIKE 'pg_%' AND conrelid::regclass::text NOT LIKE 'sql_%'
ORDER BY conname;


5. What is difference between Primary Key, Foreign Key and Unique Contraints.
Primary key:-A primary key constraint is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. 
Foreign key:-A foreign key constraint is used to link one table to another table. 
Unique Constraints:-A unique constraint is used to ensure that the values in a column or set of columns are unique across all rows in the table.

6. Get list of indexes for each tables.
SELECT 
    t.relname AS table_name, 
    i.relname AS index_name, 
    pg_get_indexdef(i.oid) AS index_definition
FROM 
    pg_class t, 
    pg_class i, 
    pg_index ix
WHERE 
    t.oid = ix.indrelid AND
    i.oid = ix.indexrelid AND
    t.relkind = 'r'
ORDER BY 
    t.relname, 
    i.relname;

7. Understand table structures along with relationships, for each table look at data and see if they are in 1 Normal form, 2nd Normal Form or 3rd Normal form. Format should be
<Table> <Name> <Normal Form Reason>
Table Name: actor
Normal Form: 1st Normal Form
Reason: All attributes are atomic and there are no repeating groups.

Table Name: address
Normal Form: 1st Normal Form
Reason: All attributes are atomic and there are no repeating groups.

Table Name: category
Normal Form: 1st Normal Form
Reason: All attributes are atomic and there are no repeating groups.

Table Name: film
Normal Form: 1st Normal Form
Reason: All attributes are atomic and there are no repeating groups.

Table Name: film_actor
Normal Form: 2nd Normal Form

Table Name: language
Normal Form: 1st Normal Form
Reason: All attributes are atomic and there are no repeating groups.

Table Name: payment
Normal Form: 2nd Normal Form
Reason: The table has a composite primary key made up of three foreign keys, but there are no partial dependencies.

Table Name: rental
Normal Form: 2nd Normal Form
Reason: The table has a composite primary key made up of two foreign keys, but there are no partial dependencies.

Table Name: staff
Normal Form: 1st Normal Form
